description: "Module for representing Relation Graphs.\n\nThe core concept in a relation\
  \ graph is an [Edge](Edge.md), which consists of\n\n * [subject](subject.md)\n *\
  \ [predicate](predicate.md)\n * [object](object.md)\n\nWhen mapping from OWL, an\
  \ Edge corresponds to one of:\n\n * `A SubClassOf B`, where `B` is a named class,\
  \ and the predicate is rdfs:subClassOf\n * `A SubClassOf P some B`, and the predicate\
  \ is `P`"

  relation_graph_construct:
    description: A construct used as part of a Relation Graph
    todos:
    - consider moving this to its own module
    comments:
    - Relation Graphs are complementary abstractions to OWL in which axioms of the
      form A SubClassOf R some C form individual edges

    slots:
      - subject
      - predicate
      - object
  edge:
    description: A relation graph edge that connects two entities by a predicate.
      Note an edge is distinct from a statement, in that an axiom such as A SubClassOf
      R some B is represented as multiple statements, but is a single relation graph
      edge
    notes:
    - this should hold direct edges. See also entailed_edge

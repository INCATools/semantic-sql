types:
  node id type:
    description: IDs are either CURIEs, IRI, or blank nodes. IRIs are wrapped in <>s
      to distinguish them from CURIEs, but in general it is good practice to populate
      the [prefixes][Prefixes.md] table such that they are shortened to CURIEs. Blank
      nodes are ids starting with `_:`.

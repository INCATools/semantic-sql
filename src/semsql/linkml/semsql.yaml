title: Semantic SQL
description: |-
  A datamodel for RDF, OWL, and OBO Ontologies designed to work harmoniously with SQL databases.

  Note that the primary purpose of this linkml schema is to organize and define SQL VIEWs to
  be used on top of a generic SQL database following the rdftab statements schema.
  These SQL views are encoded with the `sqlviews>>` tag inside the yaml.

  We use linkml to do this rather than a simple SQL DDL file because linkml gives
  us a standard way to do things such as:

    * attach descriptions to each view
    * define a data dictionary of all columns used, together with domains/ranges
    * modular structure with imports
    * the ability to attach rich semantic metadata to each schema element

  Additionally, the framework provides automatic compilation to SQLAlchemy models,
  and tools for being able to turn views into indexed tables for efficient querying,
  as well as a rich searchable documentation system and other tooling.

  This schema is best browsed online: https://cmungall.github.io/semantic-sql/

  Note that things are in flux, and there some oddities that need ironed out, see
  issues for details.

  See the [github repo](https://github.com/cmungall/semantic-sql) for code to convert
  from the linkml yaml into SQL DDL
